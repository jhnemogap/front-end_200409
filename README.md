# Front-end exercise (2020/04/09)

## Description result of the exercise

In this exercise, html5 and css3 are used directly without javascript intervention.

JavaScript code is only used to apply the menu effect, and also to color card titles.

The page was intended to be presented mobile-first ([Link to Exercise](https://jhnemogap.github.io/front-end_exercise_200409/)). The similarity of the replica made can be seen from a width greater than 1024px and better from 1200px onwards.

**NOTE**: It was decided to make some visual improvements to the mockup to improve the presentation on different device sizes, specifically increasing the font size accordingly.

### Documentation

For this stage of the project, the html and css documentation was done in the same files with internal comments.

The javascript files received internal comments using the base tag naming used by projects like `documentjs` or `JSDoc`; but without installing any dependency at the moment.

### Proposed file structure

- **`index.html`**: all html web page in and entry point
- **`css`**: all files type `.css`
  - **`mediaQueries`**: this folder exclusively contains media queries
- **`image`**: images to serve. `.Webp` images were used to test their functionality
- **`js`**: all `.js` type documents
